# Graph Improvement Proposals

## About

Read more about how the protocol is governed [here](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/governance/) (a more extensive version [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/introducing-the-graph-council/)).
This repository holds the GIP template contributors should fork to properly present suggested improvements or ideas with the community and core developers. More details on the process can be found in the **Contributing** section below. 

## In this repo

- GIPs - Proposals for improving protocol logic, interfaces, functionality, charters, or processes.
- GRPs - Requests for proposals that solve some important problem or address a needed use case for The Graph.
- GRCs - Requests for comments on application-layer community standards for building on The Graph.


## Contributing

See [GIP-0000](gips/0000-template.md) for a template and [GIP-0001](gips/0001-gip-process.md) for an overview of the proposal process, including how to submit a proposal.

### *Notes*: 
GIP-0001 will soon be updated to reflect the editorial process and new proposed overall process. In the meantime:
1. Fork the GIP template and open up a PR once ready.
2. Do not create a thread in the Forum until instructed to do so by the repo maintainer (Editor).
